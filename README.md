# Gaze Estimation with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks

This repository contains work for the project "Gaze Estimation with Deep Convolutional Neyral Networks" as part of the KTH MSc Machine Learning course DD2424 Deep Learning in Data Science, implemented in the Tensorflow-gpu library in the Google Cloud Platform.  

This work could not have been done without the help and collaboration of [Pantelis Myriokefalitakis](https://github.com/pantelismyr).
